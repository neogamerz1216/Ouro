## Usage statistics collection in Ouro

By default, Ouro sends some statistics about how it's used. Currently, these include:

* Your operating system and computer language
* When you installed Ouro
* The version of Ouro that you're using
* How often you use certain features in Ouro
* An anonymous ID representing your installation of Ouro

Collecting this data allows us to prioritize which devices and operating systems we test and which features we work on.

Ouro does not send:
* Anything that can be used to personally identify you
* Any browsing history, passwords, or other data stored locally in Ouro

If you want to opt-out of statistics collection, you can do so by going to the preferences page within Ouro and de-selecting "send usage statistics".
